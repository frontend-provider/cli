       Find security issues in your Infrastructure as Code files.

       For more information see IaC help page [4mhttps://snyk.co/ucT6Q[0m

[1mCOMMANDS[0m
       [1mtest   [22mTest for any known issue.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m--detection-depth[22m=[4mDEPTH[0m
              (only in [1mtest [22mcommand)
              Indicate  the  maximum depth of sub-directories to search. [4mDEPTH[0m
              must be a number.

              Default: No Limit
              Example: [1m--detection-depth=3[0m
              Will limit search to provided directory (or current directory if
              no [4mPATH[24m provided) plus two levels of subdirectories.

       [1m--severity-threshold[22m=low|medium|high|critical
              Only  report  configuration  issues  with  the provided severity
              level or higher. Please note that  the  Snyk  Infrastructure  as
              Code  configuration  issues  do  not  currently use the [1mcritical[0m
              severity level.

       [1m--ignore-policy[0m
              Ignores all set policies. The current policy in [1m.snyk [22mfile,  Org
              level ignores and the project policy on snyk.io.

       [1m--json [22mPrints results in JSON format.

       [1m--json-file-output[22m=[4mOUTPUT_FILE_PATH[0m
              (only  in [1mtest [22mcommand) Save test output in JSON format directly
              to the specified file, regardless of whether or not you use  the
              [1m--json  [22moption. This is especially useful if you want to display
              the human-readable test output via stdout and at the  same  time
              save the JSON format output to a file.

       [1m--org[22m=[4mORG_NAME[0m
              Specify the [4mORG_NAME[24m to run Snyk commands tied to a specific or-
              ganization. This will influence private  tests  limits.  If  you
              have  multiple organizations, you can set a default from the CLI
              using:

              [1m$ snyk config set org[22m=[4mORG_NAME[0m

              Setting a default will ensure all newly tested projects will  be
              tested  under your default organization. If you need to override
              the default, you can use the [1m--org[22m=[4mORG_NAME[24m  argument.  Default:
              uses  [4mORG_NAME[24m  that  sets  as  default in your Account settings
              [4mhttps://app.snyk.io/account[0m

       [1m--policy-path[22m=[4mPATH_TO_POLICY_FILE[24m`
              Manually pass a path to a snyk policy file.

       [1m--sarif[0m
              Return results in SARIF format.

       [1m--sarif-file-output[22m=[4mOUTPUT_FILE_PATH[0m
              (only in [1mtest [22mcommand) Save test output in SARIF format directly
              to  the  [4mOUTPUT_FILE_PATH[24m file, regardless of whether or not you
              use the [1m--sarif [22moption. This is especially useful if you want to
              display  the  human-readable  test  output via stdout and at the
              same time save the SARIF format output to a file.

       [1m--scan=[4m[22mTERRAFORM_PLAN_SCAN_MODE[0m
              Dedicated flag for Terraform plan scanning modes.
              It enables to control whether the scan should analyse  the  full
              final  state (e.g. [1mplanned-values[22m), or the proposed changes only
              (e.g. [1mresource-changes[22m).
              Default: If the [1m--scan [22mflag is not provided it  would  scan  the
              proposed changes only by default.
              Example  #1: [1m--scan=planned-values [22m(full state scan) Example #2:
              [1m--scan=resource-changes [22m(proposed changes scan)

       [1m--rules=[4m[22mPATH_TO_CUSTOM_RULES_BUNDLE[0m
              Dedicated flag for Custom Rules scanning.
              It enables the IaC scans to use a custom rules bundle  generated
              via  the [1msnyk-iac-rules [22mSDK. To download it and learn how to use
              it, go to https://github.com/snyk/snyk-iac-rules. This flag can-
              not be used if the custom rules settings were configured via the
              Snyk UI. Default: If the [1m--rules [22mflag is not provided  it  would
              scan the configuration files using the internal Snyk rules only.
              Example:  [1m--rules=bundle.tar.gz  [22m(scans  the configuration files
              using custom rules and internal Snyk rules)

[1mEXIT CODES[0m
       Possible exit codes and their meaning:

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       You can set these environment variables to change CLI run settings.

       [1mSNYK_TOKEN[0m
              Snyk  authorization token. Setting this envvar will override the
              token that may be available in your [1msnyk config [22msettings.

       [1mSNYK_CFG_KEY[0m
              Allows you to override any key that's  also  available  as  [1msnyk[0m
              [1mconfig [22moption.

              E.g. [1mSNYK_CFG_ORG[22m=myorg will override default org option in [1mcon-[0m
              [1mfig [22mwith "myorg".

       [1mSNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME[0m
              Specify a username to use when connecting to  a  container  reg-
              istry.  Note  that  using the [1m--username [22mflag will override this
              value. This will be ignored in favour  of  local  Docker  binary
              credentials when Docker is present.

       [1mSNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD[0m
              Specify  a  password  to use when connecting to a container reg-
              istry. Note that using the [1m--password [22mflag  will  override  this
              value.  This  will  be  ignored in favour of local Docker binary
              credentials when Docker is present.

[1mConnecting to Snyk API[0m
       By default Snyk CLI will connect to [1mhttps://snyk.io/api/v1[22m.

       [1mSNYK_API[0m
              Sets API host to use for Snyk requests.  Useful  for  on-premise
              instances and configuring proxies. If set with [1mhttp [22mprotocol CLI
              will upgrade the  requests  to  [1mhttps[22m.  Unless  [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTO-[0m
              [1mCOL_UPGRADE [22mis set to [1m0[22m.

       [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE[22m=0
              If  set  to the value of [1m0[22m, API requests aimed at [1mhttp [22mURLs will
              not be upgraded to [1mhttps[22m. If not set, the default behavior  will
              be  to  upgrade  these requests from [1mhttp [22mto [1mhttps[22m. Useful e.g.,
              for reverse proxies.

       [1mHTTPS_PROXY [22mand [1mHTTP_PROXY[0m
              Allows you to specify a proxy to use for [1mhttps [22mand  [1mhttp  [22mcalls.
              The  [1mhttps  [22min  the  [1mHTTPS_PROXY [22mmeans that [4mrequests[24m [4musing[24m [1mhttps[0m
              protocol will use this proxy. The proxy itself doesn't  need  to
              use [1mhttps[22m.

[1mNOTICES[0m
   [1mSnyk API usage policy[0m
       The  use of Snyk's API, whether through the use of the 'snyk' npm pack-
