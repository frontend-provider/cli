              E.g. [1mSNYK_CFG_ORG[22m=myorg will override default org option in [1mcon-[0m
              [1mfig [22mwith "myorg".

       [1mSNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME[0m
              Specify a username to use when connecting to  a  container  reg-
              istry.  Note  that  using the [1m--username [22mflag will override this

[1mConnecting to Snyk API[0m
       By default Snyk CLI will connect to [1mhttps://snyk.io/api/v1[22m.

       [1mSNYK_API[0m
              Sets API host to use for Snyk requests.  Useful  for  on-premise
              instances and configuring proxies. If set with [1mhttp [22mprotocol CLI
              will upgrade the  requests  to  [1mhttps[22m.  Unless  [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTO-[0m
              [1mCOL_UPGRADE [22mis set to [1m0[22m.

       [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE[22m=0
              If  set  to the value of [1m0[22m, API requests aimed at [1mhttp [22mURLs will
              not be upgraded to [1mhttps[22m. If not set, the default behavior  will
              be  to  upgrade  these requests from [1mhttp [22mto [1mhttps[22m. Useful e.g.,
              for reverse proxies.

       [1mHTTPS_PROXY [22mand [1mHTTP_PROXY[0m
              Allows you to specify a proxy to use for [1mhttps [22mand  [1mhttp  [22mcalls.
              The  [1mhttps  [22min  the  [1mHTTPS_PROXY [22mmeans that [4mrequests[24m [4musing[24m [1mhttps[0m
              protocol will use this proxy. The proxy itself doesn't  need  to
              use [1mhttps[22m.

[1mNOTICES[0m
