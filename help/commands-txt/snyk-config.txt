[1mConnecting to Snyk API[0m
       By default Snyk CLI will connect to [1mhttps://snyk.io/api/v1[22m.

       [1mSNYK_API[0m
              Sets  API  host  to use for Snyk requests. Useful for on-premise

              will  upgrade  the  requests  to  [1mhttps[22m. Unless [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTO-[0m

              not  be upgraded to [1mhttps[22m. If not set, the default behavior will
              be to upgrade these requests from [1mhttp [22mto  [1mhttps[22m.  Useful  e.g.,
              for reverse proxies.
