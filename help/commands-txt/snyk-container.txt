       [1m3[22m: failure, no supported projects detected

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       You can set these environment variables to change CLI run settings.

       [1mSNYK_TOKEN[0m
              Snyk authorization token. Setting this envvar will override  the
              token that may be available in your [1msnyk config [22msettings.

       [1mSNYK_CFG_KEY[0m
              Allows  you  to  override  any key that's also available as [1msnyk[0m
              [1mconfig [22moption.

              E.g. [1mSNYK_CFG_ORG[22m=myorg will override default org option in [1mcon-[0m
              [1mfig [22mwith "myorg".

       [1mSNYK_REGISTRY_USERNAME[0m
              Specify  a  username  to use when connecting to a container reg-
              istry. Note that using the [1m--username [22mflag  will  override  this
              value.  This  will  be  ignored in favour of local Docker binary
              credentials when Docker is present.

       [1mSNYK_REGISTRY_PASSWORD[0m
              Specify a password to use when connecting to  a  container  reg-
              istry.  Note  that  using the [1m--password [22mflag will override this

[1mConnecting to Snyk API[0m
       By default Snyk CLI will connect to [1mhttps://snyk.io/api/v1[22m.

       [1mSNYK_API[0m
              Sets  API  host  to use for Snyk requests. Useful for on-premise
              instances and configuring proxies. If set with [1mhttp [22mprotocol CLI
              will  upgrade  the  requests  to  [1mhttps[22m. Unless [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTO-[0m
              [1mCOL_UPGRADE [22mis set to [1m0[22m.

       [1mSNYK_HTTP_PROTOCOL_UPGRADE[22m=0
              If set to the value of [1m0[22m, API requests aimed at [1mhttp  [22mURLs  will
              not  be upgraded to [1mhttps[22m. If not set, the default behavior will
              be to upgrade these requests from [1mhttp [22mto  [1mhttps[22m.  Useful  e.g.,
              for reverse proxies.

       [1mHTTPS_PROXY [22mand [1mHTTP_PROXY[0m
              Allows  you  to specify a proxy to use for [1mhttps [22mand [1mhttp [22mcalls.
              The [1mhttps [22min the [1mHTTPS_PROXY [22mmeans  that  [4mrequests[24m  [4musing[24m  [1mhttps[0m
              protocol  will  use this proxy. The proxy itself doesn't need to
              use [1mhttps[22m.

[1mNOTICES[0m
   [1mSnyk API usage policy[0m
       The use of Snyk's API, whether through the use of the 'snyk' npm  pack-
