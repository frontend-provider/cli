      "description": "## Overview\nA potential memory disclosure vulnerability exists in sequelize versions prior to 3.17.2.\nA field of type `DataTypes.BLOB` can be used to expose sensitive information such as code, runtime memory and user data into MongoDB.\n\n### Details\n`sequelize` uses the `Buffer` type to represent `DataTypes.BLOB`. \nInitializing a `Buffer` with integer `N` creates a `Buffer`\nof length `N` with non zero-ed out memory.\n**Example:**\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100); // uninitialized Buffer of length 100\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100'); // initialized Buffer with value of '100'\n```\nInitializing a `BLOB` field in such manner will dump uninitialized\nmemory into the database.\nThe patch wraps `Buffer` field initialization in sequelize by converting a\n`number` value `N` to a string, initializing the `Buffer` with `N` in its\nascii form.\n\n#### Proof of concept\n```javascript\nvar Sequelize = require('sequelize');\nvar sequelize = new Sequelize('pastebin', null, null,\n    { host: '127.0.0.1', dialect: 'postgres', });\n\nvar Task = sequelize.define('Pastebin', {\n    title: Sequelize.STRING,\n    content: Sequelize.BLOB,\n  });\n\nTask.create({\n  title: 'title',\n  content: 100,\n}).then(function (task) {\n  console.log(task.title);\n  console.log(task.content); // will print out 100 bytes of previously used memory\n});\n```\n\n## Remediation\nUpgrade `mongoose` to version >= 3.17.3\n\n## References\n- https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/master/changelog.md#3172\n- https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/commit/cbfaa4f0a135cfc55874c9bfc39ead2d85c417e9\n- https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Lets-fix-Buffer-API.md#previous-materials\n- https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Buffer-knows-everything.md\n",
