      "description": "## Overview\n[Tom MacWright](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/751) discovered that UglifyJS versions 2.4.23 and earlier are affected by a vulnerability which allows a specially crafted Javascript file to have altered functionality after minification. This bug was [demonstrated](https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/backdooring-js/) by [Yan](https://twitter.com/bcrypt) to allow potentially malicious code to be hidden within secure code, activated by minification.\n\n_Source: [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/39)_\n\n\n### Details\n\nIn Boolean algebra, DeMorgan's laws describe the relationships between conjunctions ( && ), disjunctions ( || ) and negations ( ! ).\nIn Javascript form, they state that:\n !(a && b) === (!a) || (!b)\n !(a || b) === (!a) && (!b)\n\nThe law does not hold true when one of the values is not a boolean however.\n\nVulnerable versions of UglifyJS do not account for this restriction, and erroneously apply the laws to a statement if it can be reduced in length by it.\n\nConsider this authentication function:\n\n```\nfunction isTokenValid(user) {\n    var timeLeft =\n        !!config && // config object exists\n        !!user.token && // user object has a token\n        !user.token.invalidated && // token is not explicitly invalidated\n        !config.uninitialized && // config is initialized\n        !config.ignoreTimestamps && // don't ignore timestamps\n        getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry); // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n\n    // The token must not be expired\n    return timeLeft > 0;\n}\n\nfunction getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n  return expiry - getSystemTime();\n}\n```\nWhen minified with a vulnerable version of UglifyJS, it will produce the following insecure output, where a token will never expire:\n\n( Formatted for readability )\n\n```\nfunction isTokenValid(user) {\n    var timeLeft = !(                       // negation\n        !config                             // config object does not exist\n        || !user.token                      // user object does not have a token\n        || user.token.invalidated           // token is explicitly invalidated\n        || config.uninitialized             // config isn't initialized\n        || config.ignoreTimestamps          // ignore timestamps\n        || !getTimeLeft(user.token.expiry)  // > 0 if expiration is in the future\n    );\n    return timeLeft > 0\n}\n\nfunction getTimeLeft(expiry) {\n    return expiry - getSystemTime()\n}\n```\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade UglifyJS to version >= 2.4.24.\n\n## References\n- https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/39\n- https://github.com/tmcw/mdast-uglify-bug\n- https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/backdooring-js/\n- https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/751\n",
